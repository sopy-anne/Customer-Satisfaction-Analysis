## Introduction
This capstone project analyses customer satisfaction survey data from Dano Airline, a UK-based carrier headquartered in London.
The customer satisfaction survey aims to evaluate customer experiences across different service areas, covering pre-boarding, in-flight, and post-boarding services, to better understand how passengers feel about its services.

The objective of this analysis was to:
- Identify key pain points driving dissatisfaction.
- Highlight the service areas most strongly linked to satisfaction.
- Provide insights that can guide business decisions to improve overall customer experience.

## Dataset and Methodology
The dataset included passenger demographics and travel information such as gender, age, customer type, travel type, and airline class. It also contained customer ratings (on a 5-point scale) across multiple service factors:
- Travel distance
- Departure and arrival delays
- Convenience of arrival/departure
- Ease of booking and boarding
- Check-in service & gate location
- On-board service, seat comfort, legroom
- Cleanliness, food and drink, in-flight service
- In-flight WiFi and entertainment
- Baggage handling
- Satisfaction (Neutral/Dissatisfied, Satisfied)
### Data Preparation and Analysis
To make the dataset analysis-ready; 
- Power Query was used to clean and transform the dataset.
- Missing values were filled with average responses.
- Age was grouped into meaningful brackets (Children, Teenagers, Young Adults, Adults, Senior Adults, Elderly).
- DAX functions on Power BI were applied to calculate averages and totals across service factors.
## Skills/Concept Demonstration 
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Data transformation and modeling
- Data visualization and analysis
- Business Insights and storytelling
### Visualization and Dashboard
- Bar charts were used to compare satisfaction levels across demographic categories, and
- Key Influencers visual (Power BI) was applied to uncover which factors most strongly influenced customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

Here is the one-page dashboard summarising the insights:

## Key Insights
### 1. Demographics
- The majority of customers (57%) are dissatisfied.
- By age category, most children, teenagers, the elderly, and young adults are dissatisfied.
- Senior adults were mostly satisfied (58%); however, they accounted for the second largest dissatisfied age category, next to adults.
- Both male and female passengers were more likely to be dissatisfied than satisfied, with only slight differences between genders.
### 2. Customer Type & Travel Purpose
-	The majority of satisfied customers (70%) were returning business-class passengers.
-	While 49% of dissatisfied customers were returning economy-class passengers.
-	Personal travel passengers were overwhelmingly dissatisfied (90%), while business travel passengers were mostly satisfied (58%).
### 3.  Key influences
- On-board services had the highest negative influence on the overall customer dissatisfaction, which had an exponential influence on business-class passengers.
-	Check-in services were the next top negative driver of dissatisfaction, especially for first-time customers and those travelling for personal reasons.
-	Cleanliness was a major dissatisfaction driver among economy and economy plus passengers.
-	Arrival and departure convenience had the least influence on dissatisfaction.

### Analysis Limitations
This analysis did not cover every service offered by Dano Airlines. Instead, it focused on selected aspects of pre-boarding, in-flight, and post-boarding services, summarized into a one-page dashboard for clarity and ease of interpretation.

## Recommendations
- The on-board services should be improved to meet the aviation standard, and be tailored to meet the needs of business-class travellers who expect higher standards.
- The process of check-in services should be streamlined with more self-service options and staff support for first-time travellers.
- Cleaning routines should be prioritised, particularly for economy and economy plus cabins.
- Loyalty incentives could be provided for dissatisfied groups (children, teenagers, economy class) to rebuild trust.
- Efforts should be made to balance the overall experience of passengers regardless of demographic category or class.

By focusing on the critical pain points, check-in services, cleanliness, and on-board experiences, the airline has the opportunity to significantly increase customer satisfaction and strengthen its competitive edge in the market.
